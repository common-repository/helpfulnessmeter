= Credit Where Credit’s Due =

This plugin is 95% fork of WaspThemes’s WordPress plugin [Was This Helpful?](https://wordpress.org/plugins/was-this-article-helpful/). Since the "Was This Helpful?" plugin is not actively maintained and not tested with the latest version of WordPress, I decided to take it over and continue to improve.

= Review =

Great people use HelpfulnessMeter to [leave their best review afterwards…](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/helpfulnessmeter/reviews/) and you are great too!

Depending on your configuration choices, you could find the voting statistics for your content in a new column in the list of your posts for example (if you have configured HelpfulnessMeter globally for your posts). You can also use the shortcode `[helpfulness_meter]` to manually put the HelpfulnessMeter voting inset in your content. You may also need to list all content stats where the above shortcode is manually added, in that case I invite you to create a private page and paste the below shortcode to do so: `[hfnm_shortcode_list]`.
